### *What is the E-Voting System?*
---
A simple system built to showcase an example of an Electronic voting system.
E-voting, or electronic voting, refers to computerized voting machines that use electronic ballots rather than paper ones. They're also known as direct-recording electronic machines, or DREs. 
Voters could cast ballots from anywhere, including their own homes.	
This type of internet voting would probably be used in addition to voting at traditional polling sites as opposed to as a replacement since there are security and privacy problems to consider.

### *Potential Security Problems*
---
Insider attacks – hard to fully audit code, esp. if proprietary, closed source.

Computer compromises – how can you guarantee the machines used to vote aren’t infected by vote-stealing viruses.

Network problems – how do you make sure Denial of Service attacks don’t take down network infrastructure or servers.

Server protection – how to make sure servers are secure, should ideally be under direct govt control.

Authorization and Identification - Because no election officials would be present, this type of voting would require a new way to ensure each voters identity such as social security verification.

Public confidence – how do you convince voters that election was fair?
