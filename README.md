### *What is the E-Voting System?*
---
Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting votes.
E-voting, or electronic voting, refers to computerized voting machines that use electronic ballots rather than paper ones. They're also known as direct-recording electronic machines, or DREs. 
Voters could cast ballots from anywhere, including their own homes.	
Because no election officials would be present, this type of voting would require a new way to ensure each voters identity
This type of internet voting would probably be used in addition to voting at traditional polling sites as opposed to as a replacement.

### *Potential Security Problems of current version*
---
Insider attacks – hard to fully audit code, esp. if proprietary, closed source 
Computer compromise – how can you guarantee the machines used to vote aren’t infected by vote-stealing viruses
Network problems – how do you make sure Denial of Service attacks don’t take down network infrastructure or servers
Server protection – easier as centralised and under direct govt control
Public confidence – how do you convince voters that election was fair?
